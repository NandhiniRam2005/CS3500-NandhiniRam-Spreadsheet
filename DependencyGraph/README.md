# Assignment Specific Topics

This project implements a DependencyGraph class, where a DependencyGraph is a collection of dependencies 
between strings, where a string (node) may depend on others (dependees) or may be depended upon by others 
(dependents). The class provides methods to manage these dependencies, retrieve dependents and dependees 
of nodes, and modify dependencies between nodes.
