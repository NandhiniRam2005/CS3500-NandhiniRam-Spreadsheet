# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of constructing a formula and checking its validity.
It checks the tokens in the formula including variables, numeric values, parenthesis, and normalizes 
them when necessary, throwing a FormulaFormatException when invalid tokens are present with a meaningful message.
The program also includes methods to retrieve variables from formulas and return formulas as strings.

Future extensions of the program include implementing a dependency graph to manage cell relationships, 
calculating the formulas mathematically, and adding GUIs for a visual element to the Spreadsheet.
